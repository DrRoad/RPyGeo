RPyGeo 1.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:

RPyGeo 1.0.0 is now available on CRAN. It is a major update with a completely new codebase. The new interface between ArcGIS and R is now based on the reticulate package. The reticulate package accesses the ArcPy Python side-package and provides all ArcPy functions and classes in the R session.

Features:

 **Workflow**

RPyGeo aims to create an environment, in which the user can perform ArcGIS and R functions on the same dataset in a contiguous workflow. For that, two new functions are integrated into RPyGeo.

 * `rpygeo_load()` - Load the output of ArcPy functions into the R session
 * `rpygeo_save()` - Save temporary files to the workspace

Moreover, ArcPy functions can be chained together with the `%>%` operator now.


 **Map algebra**

To perform mathematical calculations with raster objects, four new operators are available: 

 * `%rpygeo_+%` 
 * `%rpygeo_-%` 
 * `%rpygeo_*%`
 * `%rpygeo_/%`


 **Search and help**

ArcPy help files are now directly displayed in the RStudio viewer panel or the default browser with the `rpygeo_help` function. The `rpygeo_search` function searches for ArcPy functions based on plain text or regular expressions.


 **Code completion**

ArcPy functions and classes are code completed in RStudio now.


 **File geodatabases**

All new functions are compatible with file geodatabases. Feature classes can be loaded directly into the R session. Raster files are exported first and then automatically loaded.
