## Introduction

**RPyGeo** establishes an interface to the geoprocessing tools of ArcMap from within R.
Since ArcMap only provides a Python API for a low-level access of its geoalgorithms, **RPyGeo** establishes a tunnel to Python via the **reticulate** package.
This extends R's spatial capabilities [@bivand_applied_2013; @hijmans_raster_2017; @pebesma_simple_2018] by the geoalgorithms (many of which are unavailable in R) and the geoprocessing power of a Desktop GIS (usually written in a compiled programming language).
Combining this with the statistical and data science power of R opens the way to advanced console-base statistical geoprocessing [@muenchow_rqgis_2017]. 

## ArcPy

To use **RpyGeo** properly at least a basic understanding of ArcPy is necessary.
ArcPy is a Python side-package that allows geographic data analysis through ArcGIS from the Python command line.
ArcPy is organized into modules, which are Python files with functions and classes. The ArcPy main module has several hundred functions and classes. 
It is supported by various modules like the `data access` module or extensions like the `spatial analysis` extension, which increase the number of functions and classes further. 
We do recommend to get familiar with ArcPy through the official [help pages](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/main/arcgis-pro-arcpy-reference.htm). 
There also several books available on ArcGIS and ArcPy such as 
@zandbergen_python_2013 and [@pimpler_programming_2015].
<!-- JM: not really sure what you would like to say here or if this might be even too much detail


The ArcPy functions are essentially wrapper for the ArcGIS geoprocessing tools and other scripting tasks.  
The ArcPy classes are blueprints for any kind of object in ArcPy. 
For example, `Point` and `Raster` are classes to describe geographic data. ArcPy classes are also used to set geoprocessing environment settings (e.g., `workspace` or `extent`).

## Tutorial

In order to use **RPyGeo** you need a working ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro installation on your computer. 

This tutorial requires the following packages to be installed and attached:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("RpyGeo")
library("spData")
library("sf")
library("raster")
library("magrittr")
```

<!-- well, this is an "artificial" dem, why don't you just use data(dem, package = "RQGIS")-->
To demonstrate both raster and vector operations we will use the raster object `elev` and the vector object `nz` from the **spData** package.
To make these datasets available for the subsequent ArcMap geoprocessing, we have to save them on disk.
Therefore, we export `nz` and `elev` to a temporary directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(elev, nz, package = "spData")
writeRaster(elev, file.path(tempdir(), "elev.tif"), format = "GTiff")
st_write(nz, file.path(tempdir(), "nz.shp"))
```

### Establishing the ArcPy Python interface

Powered by **reticulate**, `rpygeo_build_env()` will establish an R interface to Python.
ArcPy will only work with the Python binary that comes with the ArcGIS installation.
If this Python binary is not installed in the default location (`C:/Python27` in the case of ArcMap and `C:/Program Files/ArcGIS/Pro/bin/Python/envs/arcgispro-py3` in the case of ArcGIS Pro), one can set it explicitly with the `path` parameter of `rpygeo_build_env()`. 
Secondly, `rpygeo_build_env()` loads the `arcpy` library.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arcpy <- rpygeo_build_env(workspace = tempdir(),
                          overwrite = TRUE,
                          extensions = "Spatial")
```

`rpygeo_build_env()` lets the user also specify further common ArcGIS environment settings.
For instance, setting `overwrite` to `TRUE` lets the user overwrite already existing spatial objects later on with outputs created by ArcPy geoalgorithms.
The `extensions` parameter allows also the activation of extensions.^[The availability of extensions is dependent on the purchased ArcGIS license.]
In the code chunk above, we have enabled the Spatial Analysis extension.
The `workspace` parameter defines the default directory where to save the outputs of geoprocessing functions and in which to look for spatial objects. 
Note that the workspace can be a directory or an ESRI file geodatabase.^[If you work with large raster files we would recommend to use a directory, because it takes a long time to load raster datasets from a file geodatabase into an R session.]
A scratch workspace folder is automatically created inside the workspace. 
The scratch workspace usually contains the output files of functions that do not explicitly provide an output parameter as is the case for most spatial analyst raster algorithms.
To change the default scratch workspace location, use parameter `scratch_workspace`.

### Find out about ArcPy functionality

If you do not know the name of the ArcPy function or class, the `rpygeo_search` function can be used. 
The search term can be plain text or a regular expression.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rpygeo_search(search_term = "3d", module = arcpy)
```

In this example all functions of the ArcPy main module, that contain the term `3d` in their name are returned. 

If we want to search in another module we have to change the `module` parameter.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rpygeo_search(search_term = "Classify", module = arcpy$sa)
```

Help files for each ArcPy function can be accessed with the function `rpygeo_help`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rpygeo_help(arcpy$Slope_3d)
```

The help file is displayed in the viewer pane of RStudio.
If you use RPyGeo in another IDE, the help file is displayed in the default browser.

### Use ArcPy functions

ArcPy functions can be accessed via the `$` operator.
You can take advantage of the code completion feature of RStudio.
After typing the `$` operator all functions of the ArcPy module are listed. Parameters are also autocompleted. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arcpy$Slope_3d(in_raster = "elev.tif", out_raster = "slope.tif")
```

We created a slope raster file from the elevation raster file. 
Note that `slope.tif` is written to the workspace directory and is not automatically loaded into the R session.

We can use the pipe operator `%>%` to chain ArcPy function together. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
arcpy$Dissolve_management(in_features = "nz.shp", 
                          out_feature_class = "nz_island.shp", 
                          dissolve_field = "Island") %>% 
  arcpy$PolygonToLine_management("nz_border.shp")
```

In this example the `nz.shp` shapefile is dissolved on the `Island` field and then the polygons are converted to polylines.

### Modules and extensions

RPyGeo imports all functions and classes of the available ArcPy modules and extensions. 
You can access all geoprocessing tools found in the standard toolboxes with a single `$` operator. 
To access the functions and classes of another module, you have to use a second `$` operator to specify the module.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy$sa$Slope(in_raster = "elev.tif")
```

The `Slope` function of the Spatial Analysis extension is located under `sa`. 

### Load output file into R Session

The output of an ArcPy function can be directly loaded into the R session with the `rpygeo_load` function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy$Slope_3d(in_raster = "elev.tif", out_raster = "slope.tif") %>%
  rpygeo_load() -> slope
```

The slope raster is loaded as a `raster` object into the R session.

###  Save files

Some functions have no parameter to specify an output file. 
Instead they return an object and a temporary file is saved to the workspace.
For example, the `sa$Aspect` function returns a `Raster` object and writes a temporary Arc/Info Binary Grid file to the workspace. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
arcpy$sa$Aspect(in_raster("elev.tif")) %>%
  rpygeo_save("aspect.tif")
```

### Map algebra

Map algebra expressions can be used in RPyGeo with special operators. 
The four basic calculus functions are implemented as `%rpygeo_+%`, `%rpygeo_-%`, `%rpygeo_*%`, `%rpygeo_/%`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ras <- arcpy$sa$Raster("elev.tif") 

ras %rpygeo_+% 2 %>%
  rpygeo_save("elev_2.tif")
```

In this example we created a raster object from the elevation raster. 
Then we added 2 to each pixel value. For map algebra the `rpygeo_save` function is very handy, because the output of map algebra is always a temporary file. 

## Conclusions

Please note that we could not tested each ArcPy function.
Therefore, if you encounter any bugs please report them in our [github repository](https://github.com/fapola/RPyGeo/) under issues or help us fix them them via a pull request.
